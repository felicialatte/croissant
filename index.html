    <p>
      It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
      Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.
      <br>
      <br>
      The dough is
      layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
      rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
      results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
